## Where It Started

Hi, my name is Kelsey. I’m an IT Technician with goals to get her foot into the doors of Cybersecurity. One afternoon in 2024, the Network Engineer and I at my company were discussing where I saw myself in the coming years. At the time, I was an IT Technician who had been in that role for about a year and a couple of months. I knew I’d eventually be moving on, but I wasn't sure how to make the leap.

I told him I was working on my second Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance and that my goal was to become a SOC Analyst. My biggest challenge was figuring out how to gain real hands-on experience. That's when he introduced me to homelabbing, something he was passionate about and that I had never heard of before. He started listing off subreddits I could visit to learn more: r/homelab, r/homelabs, r/minilab. It was a whole new world I was about to submerge myself in.

As our conversation wrapped up, he mentioned he had a Dell R320 server I could purchase from him for $200. It already had 6TB of storage; all I needed to do was upgrade the RAM. So I did.

And now we're here. Follow along as I document my journey learning more about the world of cybersecurity.
